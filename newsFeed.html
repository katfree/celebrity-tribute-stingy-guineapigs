            <p>Beyoncé’s website is facing legal action following claims that it fails to accommodate visually impaired users. Mary Conner, from New York, who is blind filed the class action lawsuit after recognising the website isn’t fully accessible to her or millions of others who have visual impairments.  Conner claims the website violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) by being “an exclusively visual interface” without any coded alt-text behind the images, meaning she is unable to browse the website or make online purchases without the assistance of a sighted companion. “Web accessibility requires that alt-text be coded with each picture so that a screen-reader can speak the alternative text while sighted users see the picture,” writes attorney Dan Shaked. </p>

                <p>US singer Beyoncé has performed as part of the lavish festivities at the latest extravagant Indian celebrity wedding. Isha Ambani, the daughter of India's richest man, is tying the knot with Anand Piramal, son of another Indian billionaire,this week. Beyoncé was one of many celebrities flown in, along with Bollywood stars and guests like Hillary Clinton. It comes on the heels of several recent Indian weddings competing for glamour, excess and attention. The Ambanis themselves recently attended the wedding reception of Bollywood actors Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh. And last weekend, Isha Ambani was a bridesmaid at the wedding of actress Priyanka Chopra to US singer Nick Jonas.</p>

                <p>Fresh off her dominating performance at Coachella, Beyoncé—according to reports or, at least, a trust associated with the megastar—has purchased a 100-year-old church in New Orleans. Located in the Garden District, it's just a few blocks away from where her sister, Solange, lives.The church was built in 1900 and was sitting empty after the deaths of many of its worshippers, according to the New Orleans Times–Picayune. The stone building with 7,500 square feet of interior space and 18-foot ceilings was listed for $850,000.The property was purchased on May 11 by the Noble Jones Trust, which also owns a home on Saint Ann Street, where the sisters, their mother, Tina Knowles, and the rest of the family have been seen during Mardi Gras. But based on the records, that purchase is, at best, indirectly linked to Beyonce.</p>

                <p>Beyonce thrilled fans by finally revealing the dress she wore when she and Jay-Z renewed their vows, but the biggest surprise is she went discount for the gown! Well ... a Beyonce discount, anyway. TMZ's learned she paid a little more than $10k for her gorgeous white Thelma gown by designer Galia Lahav -- $10,300 to be exact. A lot of money for most of us, for sure, but pennies for a queen. We're told her stylist went to Lahav's flagship store in April 2018 to purchase the dress, and the designer was made aware the gown MIGHT be used for the couple's 10-year anniversary vow renewal ... but it wasn't a sure thing.</p>
