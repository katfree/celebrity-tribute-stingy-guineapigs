            <h2>Intro</h2>

            <p> Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter is an American singer, songwriter, actress, record producer and dancer.
                Born
                and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child.
                She
                rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of the R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her
                father,
                Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the best-selling girl groups in history. Their hiatus saw
                Beyoncé's
                theatrical film debut in Austin Powers in Goldmember and the release of her first solo album,
                Dangerously
                in Love. The album established her as a solo artist worldwide, debuting at number one on the US
                Billboard
                200 chart and earning five Grammy Awards.
                Throughout her career, Beyoncé has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the
                world's
                best-selling music artists.</p>
