                <p>Beyoncé has been married to Jay-Z since April 4, 2008. He has been widely acknowledged as one of the
                    greatest rappers of all time. Born and raised in New York City, Jay-Z began his musical career in
                    the mid 1990s,
                    after which he released his debut studio album, Reasonable Doubt, in 1996, to widespread critical
                    and commercial success.
                    He released the album a year after founding the record label Roc-A-Fella Records. His subsequent
                    albums have also seen great praise,
                    with The Blueprint (2001) and The Black Album (2003) later being heralded as modern musical
                    classics. He followed these with the collaborative
                    album Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West, his critically lauded thirteenth studio album 4:44
                    (2017),
                    and a collaborative effort titled Everything Is Love with wife Beyoncé in 2018.
